# TEDxCambridge-PhotoGallery-in-React-JS
I volunteered at TEDxCambridge in Spring 2019. 
I am developing a photo gallery of TEDxCambridge using ReactJS and Redux.

#### What I have achieved:-
1. Built this web application with React,Redux and CSS
2. Used Redux to manage the data.
3. Connected the application with the firebase 
4. Used React Router to navigate through the application.
5. Used JSX to build user interfaces.
6. Used props to pass the data.
7. Compartmentalize the web page into Components.
8. Updated Component State to ensure responsive and interactive applications.

#### Snapshots of the Application:-
